# Tweet Predictor
## Tweet Predictor is a web app that tries to correctly predict the tweet count each week or day for several different twitter accounts.
* The app generates different graphs based on the daily or weekly time frame.
* Users will have to create an account to be able to view the graphs and tweet count predictions.
* The tweet count predictions are based on the historical moving average for the twitter account and where the current tweet count is relative to the moving average on an hourly and daily time frame.
